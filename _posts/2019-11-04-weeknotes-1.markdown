Following a trail already blazed by [Nat Buckley](https://natbuckley.co.uk/2019/01/20/weeknotes-1-tv-ads-and-business-models/), [Alice Bartlett](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes) and [Chris Zetter](https://chriszetter.com/blog/2019/10/26/a-visit-to-kew-gardens-and-a-baking-failure/) and at the very real risk of over-sharing, here are my first weeknotes:

*   I thoroughly enjoyed playing [Lucas Pope&rsquo;s multi-award-winning &ldquo;Return of the Obra Dinn&rdquo;](https://obradinn.com) which is now [available for the Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Return-of-the-Obra-Dinn-1633060.html), a game I finished while walking C back to sleep at 6 am. From the use of music and text alone, you can tell this is from the creator of [Papers, Please](https://papersplea.se);

*   I keep wanting to talk to people about how fantastic &ldquo;[Succession](https://www.hbo.com/succession)&rdquo; is but so few people have heard of it, let alone seen it. I assume this is because it&rsquo;s not on Netflix, Prime Video or the regular telly in the UK but I hope it gets the audience it deserves;

*   On that note, I was simultaneously amused and dismayed to read that [Connor Roy&rsquo;s &ldquo;hyperdecanting&rdquo; is a real thing coined by Nathan Myhrvold](https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/succession-connor-roy-hyperdecanting-wine.html);

*   While I can&rsquo;t really make time for [London Computation Club](https://london.computation.club) any more, I have been thoroughly enjoying the [`#bread` Slack channel](https://computationclub-slack.herokuapp.com/), learning how to [troubleshoot bad bakes](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/11/troubleshoot-bad-bread-messed-up-loaf.html) and experiment with [long autolyse times, baking from cold and scoring with scissors](http://tartine-bread.blogspot.com/2014/01/guest-baker-chad-robertson.html) (in fact, as I write this, I have some dough in bulk fermentation);

*   Having C in my life has predictably altered my perspective so it&rsquo;s been with some trepidation that I&rsquo;ve been listening to [Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds&rsquo; &ldquo;Ghosteen&rdquo;](https://www.nickcave.com/ghosteen/) given [its subject matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosteen#Background) but it is rather wonderful;

*   On a similarly morbid note, I&rsquo;m considering re-reading [George Saunders&rsquo; &ldquo;Lincoln in the Bardo&rdquo;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_in_the_Bardo) but I am having too much fun learning about [the Shrike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(Simmons_novel)) at the moment;

*   As a lot of care for C in the first few weeks involved staring directly at my phone, I went through a bit of a panic after reading [Nir Eyal&rsquo;s guide to avoiding digital distraction](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/12/stop-email-ping-pong-nine-ways-to-avoid-digital-distraction-nir-eyal) and followed quite a bit of advice on [how to configure your iPhone to work for you, not against you](https://medium.com/better-humans/how-to-set-up-your-iphone-for-productivity-focus-and-your-own-longevity-bb27a68cc3d8) especially around restricting notifications. I&rsquo;m not entirely convinced it has helped though as I now compulsively check applications that _may_ notify me and moving applications onto secondary screens and into folders hasn&rsquo;t really increased friction significantly;

*   While I have very rarely opened my laptop in the past two months, I couldn&rsquo;t resist the urge to format it and do a clean install of [macOS Catalina](https://www.apple.com/uk/macos/catalina/) (despite the growing [criticism of Apple&rsquo;s recent software quality](https://tidbits.com/2019/10/21/six-reasons-why-ios-13-and-catalina-are-so-buggy/)). I decided to use it as a bit of a Disaster Recovery test to see how easily I could recover my files if my hard drive was lost or failed.

    The most straightforward recovery were my photos and files stored in [iCloud](https://www.apple.com/uk/icloud/) and passwords in [our 1Password family account](https://1password.com) (though downloading over 15 years of photos took quite some time). Less successful was the restoration of my music library and many software projects from a full [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com) backup as I hadn&rsquo;t realised that Backblaze does not backup file permissions (including whether a file is executable or not). [Michael Tsai wrote about Backblaze's shortcomings in this area over five years ago](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2014/05/22/what-backblaze-doesnt-back-up/) and I ended up restoring those files from a [Time Machine backup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) I&rsquo;d done as a failsafe instead (I would have used [David Nanian&rsquo;s SuperDuper!](https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) but it doesn&rsquo;t support Catalina yet).

    Following advice from others, I&rsquo;ll probably relegate Backblaze for total disasters and introduce a [network-based Time Machine backup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202784), most likely [connected to my Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/mr-bt/raspberrypi-timemachine);

*   Thanks to [Nat Buckley mentioning Claire Saffitz in their weeknotes](https://natbuckley.co.uk/2019/08/26/weeknotes-32-the-one-about-baking/), I binged quite a few episodes of [Bon App&eacute;tit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gourmet Makes&rdquo;](https://video.bonappetit.com/series/gourmet-makes) and ended up baking [Dorie Greenspan&rsquo;s &ldquo;World Peace Cookies&rdquo;](https://doriegreenspan.com/recipe/world-peace-cookies-the-newest-version-from-dories-cookies-sneak-peek/) mentioned in the [Oreo episode](https://video.bonappetit.com/watch/pastry-chef-attempts-to-make-gourmet-oreos?c=series) and they were the best home-made cookies I&rsquo;d ever made. [Chris Zetter](https://chriszetter.com) recommended [Kate Davis&rsquo; &ldquo;Brown Butter and Toffee Chocolate Chip Cookies&rdquo; recipe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/bas-best-chocolate-chip-cookies) so I might have to give that a go soon;

*   I&rsquo;ve spent an unhealthy amount of time reading and talking about [why the latest series of the Great British Bake Off went wrong](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/30/great-british-bake-off-is-broken-heres-how-to-fix-it) but I was overjoyed to discover [a recent episode of &ldquo;Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness&rdquo; about series 5 winner, Nancy Birtwhistle](https://www.earwolf.com/episode/how-did-you-win-great-british-bake-off-with-nancy-birtwhistle-winner-of-great-british-bake-off-series-5/);

*   I have a very long, unfinished blog post about [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and [my attempts to implement debouncing with them](https://gist.github.com/mudge/eb9178a4b6d595ffde8f9cb31744afcf) that I really should finish and publish on [my consultancy website](https://www.ghostcassette.com) (especially since [Chris Patuzzo mentioned it in his latest blog post](https://tuzz.tech/blog/react-commentary-sidebar-2)) but it&rsquo;ll have to wait for another day;

*   Reader, you won&rsquo;t believe me but [I ran](/2019/01/02/2018-yearnotes.html) for the first time since I got married and, what&rsquo;s more, it was my first time around the park we&rsquo;ve lived next to for over six years;

*   I have now been a dad for nine weeks.
