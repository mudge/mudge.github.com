*   As is traditional, I spent part of the [Easter Monday bank holiday](https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays) noodling on my computer and decided to add the amount of time passed since publishing to every post, e.g.

    As this site is powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and therefore the static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), these new relative dates are calculated entirely client-side in JavaScript so they are always up-to-date, regardless when I last generated the site. As a bonus, they live update every minute so, even if you leave a post open for a while, it should still be accurate.

    In the spirit of the bank holiday, I was too lazy to come up with my own algorithm for turning distances in time into words so I decided to port [Rails' `time_ago_in_words`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/DateHelper.html#method-i-time_ago_in_words) to JavaScript.

*   Since [clearing out our planter a few weeks ago](/2020/03/22/weeknotes-21/), the sight of a rectangle of barren soil with a single, surviving [chard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chard) plant has not been a cheery one. To improve matters and following [Matt](https://twitter.com/matt_macleod)'s lead, I planted a clove of garlic in the hope some future me will be able to enjoy some homegrown wild garlic.

*   E and I watched [Bo Burnham's "Eighth Grade"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7014006/) and loved it.

    Despite receiving [a lot of critical praise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Grade_(film)#Critical_response), the movie doesn't seem to be that well known but deserves your attention.

    As [Molly Ringwald put it](https://twitter.com/MollyRingwald/status/1022250943298121728):

    > I just saw [Eighth Grade] and thought it was the best film about adolescence I've seen in a long time. Maybe ever.

*   After watching [the chefs of Bon Appétit make their favourite coffee](https://youtu.be/yssNu8Eynb8), E suggested we buy a coffee grinder. As a stereotypical programmer, I spent a lot of time in my twenties getting far too enthusiastic about coffee but stopped short of buying a conical burr grinder, placing a moratorium on any more home coffee equipment years ago.

    Back in September 2015, E and I visited Oslo and made a pilgrimage to [Tim Wendelboe](http://www.timwendelboe.no)'s café. Arriving hungry and about to ingest quite a lot of caffeine, E enquired as to whether there were any pastries or cakes on sale to be told that they served no food, lest it detract from the coffee drinking experience.

    When asking for recommendations and doing a little research led me to the [Wilfa Svart Aroma Coffee Grinder](https://www.wilfa.co.uk/product/kitchen/black-aroma/) and seeing that [Wendelboe collaborates with them](http://nordiccoffeeculture.com/a-tim-wendelboe-review-of-the-wilfa-svart-presisjon/), the decision was easy.

    While we disagree about the availability of pastries, I trust his judgement on coffee-making equipment.

*   We ended up buying [the grinder from Square Mile Coffee Roasters](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/products/wilfa-grinder) along with a bag of beans.

    The day after I received a dispatch notification, I went back to the Square Mile website to see they had launched a new 25% discount if you bought a grinder with a bag of beans. Cursing the timing, I grumbled but was still excited enough about the prospect of a new kitchen gadget that it wasn't too upsetting.

    The next day, I received the following email:

    > Dear Paul,

    > As you might know, we've recently launched our 25% GRINDATHOME discount code on all our grinders. We know, you just missed it, and to make up for it we would like to extend the discount code to your order by refunding the 25% on your recently purchased Wilfa grinder.

    In a week of extremely stressful emails, this was an unexpected and very welcome kindness.

*   It was therefore with great pleasure that I indulged in following [Blue Bottle Coffee's Chemex Brewing Guide](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/preparation-guides/chemex) yesterday and, reader, it was a glorious cup of coffee.

*   Despite hearing about it on podcasts for a while, I hadn't found a use for [iOS Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208309).

    As we were woken by C in the night and I fumbled in the dark, trying to set a timer after reassuring him (to give him chance to go back to sleep), I realised this might be the perfect use case. I created a new shortcut which allows me to set a 10 minute timer without unlocking my phone and, while it is still a pain swiping over to the Shortcuts [widget in the Today View](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207122), it is now only a single button press away.

*   In a remarkable use of a contrained medium, [Ted Littledale recreated the 15 questions Charles Ingram had to answer on "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?"](https://twitter.com/_superted/status/1250054117432664066) including "Phone a Friend" and "Ask the Audience" on Twitter.

*   E and I began watching [Alex Garland's "DEVS" on BBC iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p087gj19) and let me join [others](https://twitter.com/waxy/status/1250911854123200517) in highly recommending it. Despite the title making it sound a little like "[The IT Crowd](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-it-crowd)", it is a drama more in the vein of Garland's previous work, "[Ex Machina](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752)" and "[Annihilation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920)".

*   It has been a trying week but, as we retired for bed one evening, I accidentally kicked [C's walker](https://www.fisher-price.com/en-gb/product/learn-with-me-zebra-walker-dlf00) and, in its cheery voice, it told me to "keep going!"
