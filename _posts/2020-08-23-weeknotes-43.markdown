*   I met a former colleague at a local pub and we sat out front to catch up. After taking my order, a member of staff asked to scan my wrist with an infrared thermometer. This was an entirely new experience and I was quite giddy at having my faculties critically assessed by a beige handheld device.

*   I finished my latest contract on Friday and, due to [last week's preparation](/2020/08/16/weeknotes-42/), I write these notes on a freshly formatted laptop.

    There's something cathartic about starting afresh, clearing out my old [1Password vaults](https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults/) and asking whether each piece of software [sparks joy](https://konmari.com) or not.

*   I went down a [bit of a rabbit-hole](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/pull/88039) installing [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com) via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

*   Now that I'll be helping out with childcare more, I inevitably found myself watching [Peppa Pig](https://www.peppapig.co.uk) this morning and was reminded of [its damning satire of knowledge work](https://youtu.be/oZC790urhtw?t=136) at Daddy Pig's office.

*   [Once more, I'm not sure what's next](/2019/01/02/2018-yearnotes/) but I'm looking forward to a break and to celebrating C's first birthday.
