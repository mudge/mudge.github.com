*   It was C's "settling in" week at nursery this week. E took him in for a few hours every day to get used to the unfamiliar surroundings and his key worker. This meant ironing [name labels](https://www.easy2name.com) into all of his clothes and that he was in someone else's care for an hour or two for the first time.

    I capitalised on this strange, guilty sense of freedom by going for a run for the first time in months. I didn't get very far and spent a lot of the time trying to keep my running tights up. I also indulged in [some](https://www.netflix.com/title/80186863 "Umbrella Academy") [science fiction](https://www.netflix.com/title/80097140 "Altered Carbon").

*   [Five months ago](/2020/04/19/weeknotes-25/), I planted a clove of garlic. Today, I harvested it!

    It certainly _looks_ like a bulb of garlic but we now need to dry it out for a few days. I'm only slightly alarmed by the [RHS Gardening website's warning](https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/grow-your-own/vegetables/garlic) that growing garlic from a supermarket "may carry disease".

*   The official [GitHub CLI 1.0 was released](https://github.blog/2020-09-17-github-cli-1-0-is-now-available/). I've long used [hub](https://hub.github.com) but [as its maintainer Mislav was hired by GitHub to build GitHub CLI](https://mislav.net/2020/01/github-cli/), I'm going to try switching over.

    > work.

*   With an increasingly mobile C in nursery, E going back to work and me working with multiple clients for the first time, I'm at a bit of a loss for notes this week.
