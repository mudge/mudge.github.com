*   We're in Yorkshire spending time with our family in the run up to Christmas so please forgive the lateness of this week's notes.

*   I was very excited to consult "[Animated Knots by Grog](https://www.animatedknots.com)" to fix a new loop of string onto a duster (a lovely [bowline knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/bowline-knot) did the trick). I'd be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to mention my favourite web site: "[Ian's Shoelace Site](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/)". It embodies exactly what I love about the internet: a true labour of love that is narrow in scope but _extremely_ deep. I am yet to convert E (much to my annoyance as her laces come undone when we're out walking) but I never leave home without tying a couple of trusty [Ian's secure shoelace knots](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/secureknot.htm).

*   Travelling north meant our very first significant road trip with C so we kitted out the car with a backseat baby mirror and tentatively set off up the M1. While we were nervous about C getting upset along the way, I got to indulge in one of my great, guilty pleasures in life: spending time in motorway services. I don't just mean fancy, peaceful ones like [Tebay](https://www.tebayservices.com) but ones with appalling men's health warnings on toilet stall doors presumably targetted at long haul drivers. I'm not sure what it is about them but I find them curiously relaxing places to be; there's something about their transitory, incidental nature that is strangely freeing.

*   C met his great-grandfather and great-grand-aunt for the very first time who are 91 and 95 years his senior respectively (the latter worked at the [Avro "shadow" factory in Leeds during the Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro#History) building [Lancaster bombers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Lancaster)). I'm mostly sharing this to use the term [grand-aunt instead of great-aunt](https://blogs.ancestry.com/ancestry/2013/10/25/great-and-grand-aunts/).

*   As we're away from home in houses that actually have more than three rooms, we've been putting C down to sleep farther from us than ever before. We don't have any sort of baby monitor but I've been using [Live Listen with AirPods](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209082) to turn my phone into a microphone and listen in. It has the added benefit of meaning I get to sit with a single earpiece in like some sort of cool dude.

*   Continuing my streak of recommending [Felicity Cloake](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/felicity-cloake) recipes in the past [few](/2019/12/08/weeknotes-6/) [weeks](/2019/11/24/weeknotes-4/): we made a large batch of her [perfect mince pies](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/dec/04/felicity-cloakes-mince-pie-masterclass-an-easy-step-by-step-recipe). To be honest, I'm just excited whenever we get an excuse to use our increasingly dusty bottle of orange blossom water.

*   I tried to make a loaf of bread with my sourdough starter ("Colin") at my mum's house but got a cracking migraine early in the process which meant a 40 minute [autolyse](https://www.bakerybits.co.uk/resources/autolyse-what-why-how/) unexpectedly became a _24 hour_ autolyse. Seeing as I had already used the ingredients, I decided to go ahead with the rest of the recipe and, while the dough was extremely difficult to handle, I was pleasantly surprised to end up with a decent loaf!

    I'm increasingly inclined to agree with [James Adam](https://interblah.net):

    > I bet if you just chuck all the ingredients in a bowl, stir it once, put it in an oven whose thermostat is triggered on and off by radioactive decay, youâ€™ll get a normal loaf at the end of the process.

*   Spending time with my dad means catching glimpses of the two hour long miniature epics that are [Turkish soap operas, or "dizi"](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/13/turkish-tv-magnificent-century-dizi-taking-over-world): I never watch enough to understand the plot but you can guarantee there'll be some smouldering looks and some fantastic facial hair.
