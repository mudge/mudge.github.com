*   My sister and I baked [Liam Charles' "Mega-Choccy Stack"](https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/liam-charles-mega-choccy-stack/) from the latest series of [Junior Bake Off](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/junior-bake-off). We didn't have any double cream so I used a sachet of [Bird's](https://www.birdscustard.co.uk/#) Dream Topping instead.

*   I've created a [Trello](https://www.trello.com) board called "Leaving London".

*   I don't know how to write about our decision to leave a city I have called home for 12 years.

    [Others have written about the peculiar feeling that your life is on pause](https://tomstu.art/weeknotes-30-on-pause) but I hadn't really thought about it until we started listing all the things we need to do to sell our flat.

    > At the time of writing my life is currently happening!

    Perhaps I haven't really believed this. That I could live [five minutes at a time](/2021/01/17/weeknotes-64/) until "real life" could resume.

    That, yes, we have outgrown our flat and, yes, want to be closer to family and, yes, we're both working remotely and it seems to be going well. None of that ever connected with: right, let's sell our flat, move our belongings and [redirect our mail](https://www.royalmail.com/personal/receiving-mail/redirection).

    I originally moved to London on little more than a whim so perhaps I shouldn't be surprised that leaving would be unceremonious too.
