*   My sister and I baked [Liam Charles' "Mega-Choccy Stack"](https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/liam-charles-mega-choccy-stack/) from the latest series of [Junior Bake Off](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/junior-bake-off). We didn't have any double cream so I used a sachet of [Bird's](https://www.birdscustard.co.uk/#) Dream Topping instead.

*   I've created a [Trello](https://www.trello.com) board called "Leaving London".
