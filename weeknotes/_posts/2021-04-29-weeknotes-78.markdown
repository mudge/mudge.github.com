*   Belated notes this week.

*   I haven't been sharing updates on [our decision to leave London](/2021/02/07/weeknotes-67/) but we are simultaneously selling our flat and buying a house closer to our family.

    Bundles of paper secured with treasury tags have been handed to conveyancers, driving licences scanned while waiting, masked, in an empty waiting room. Queries sent and answered, PDFs [redacted](https://eclecticlight.co/2020/12/11/how-effective-and-safe-is-previews-redaction-tool/) and, in a particularly stressful moment this week, hot water cylinder pipework "brought up to standard" during a service.

    I am cautiously pessimistic when it comes to anything relating to property. I tell myself it is so I am prepared for the worst: should everything fall through, I will feel no different. However, the slightest hiccup (or [is that hiccough](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/91910/are-there-regional-distinctions-in-how-hiccup-hiccough-is-spelled)?) stresses me out no end so I'm not sure my strategy is working.

*   While [playing Chris Patuzzo's "Worship the Sun"](/2021/04/18/weeknotes-77/), my mid-2015 MacBook Pro began to struggle with certain parts of the game. [Using `powermetrics`](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/372928), I discovered my CPU die temperature was reaching over 80 degrees C and causing everything to slow down due to throttling.

    Desperate to finish the game, I ended up placing ice packs that came with a [DIY Shoryu Ganso Ramen kit](https://www.japancentre.com/en/products/15986-diy-shoryu-kit-shoryu-ganso-ramen) on top of the keyboard and underneath the base of my laptop. I'm not sure it made as much difference as using [OBS](https://obsproject.com)'s "low CPU usage preset" when recording but it was enough to get me through.

*   C began referring to something in his room as "norny". Baffled, we questioned him further to eventually discover he was talking about a wooden fire engine.

    What sound does a fire engine make? "Nor nee nor nee nor nee".
