*   Following [our decision](/2021/01/31/weeknotes-66/), E and I signed terms with an estate agent, booked in a photographer and opened a file with a conveyancer. We [left our flat in a hurry](/2020/12/21/weeknotes-59-and-60/) so we decided to return to prepare it for sale and bid it fare well.

    With E as a temporary driver on my dad's oversized car, we drove down and set to work removing all the clutter essential for living (particularly with a toddler) but unsightly to prospective buyers. E filled two suitcases with belongings as I pulled up weeds and removed an old planter full of dead flowers from our patio. It was a task that was literally years overdue.

    I cannot unsee what I found on the underside of long-neglected bags of compost.

    E ordered what may well be our last [Yard Sale Pizza](https://yardsalepizza.com) and I slept poorly, my mind racing with remaining jobs to do. By late morning, we'd done all we could, leaving a gooseneck kettle and a toaster on the kitchen worktop.

*   I've been helping [apply for probate](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/guide-to-probate/) and, my goodness, for the sake of your surviving relatives: please maintain a single, up-to-date list of all your assets. Every time we think we might be getting somewhere, a slip of undated paper is found that throws everything into doubt.

*   During the latest attempt, I received a notification on my phone that my beverage had reached my "perfect temperature". That's right, I indulged in an [Ember mug](https://ember.com).

    This was mostly due to [Noah Kalina and Adam Lisagor's review](https://allconsuming.show/listen/ember). As you can tell from [James Hoffmann's comments](https://youtu.be/8pPCMjqI_uw), this is obviously an absurd luxury item (let's not even mention [Rishi Sunak's unfortunate photo op](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/rishi-sunak-smart-mug-ember-coffee-week-minimum-wage-jobs-a9607341.html)):

    > I'll be honest, owning one of these will mean that your colleagues, friends and loved ones will mock you mercilessly for owning an incredibly expensive smart mug that holds coffee at a particular temperature of your choosing.

    > You should absolutely tease anyone who spent that much money on one of these... *but they're also having a kind of a good time with it.*
