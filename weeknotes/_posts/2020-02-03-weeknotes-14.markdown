excerpt: The anaesthetic properties of cloves, saline rinses, split keyboards and yelling at clouds.
---
*   Three days before attending a "[starting solids](https://www.nhs.uk/start4life/weaning/)" workshop at a local health centre, E made several batches of soup as I pressed a whole clove against the back of my mouth.

*   After two days of alternating doses of paracetamol and ibuprofen as rapidly as enclosed leaflets allowed, my dentist confirmed I had [pericoronitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericoronitis) (do not click unless you have a stomach for pink, glistening medical photography) and sent me away with a prescription for antibiotics.

*   Brushing your teeth and doing a warm saline rinse every time you eat really makes one reconsider snacking. (Apologies to [Nat](https://natbuckley.co.uk) and [Tom](https://tomstu.art) for mentioning [the wretched task](https://natbuckley.co.uk/2019/06/02/weeknotes-20-the-wretched-task/).)

*   The elation felt when you can once again eat your morning porridge without first thoroughly mashing banana with a fork is exquisite.

*   I am clumsily typing this on a [Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-gb/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00006). The split keys make me realise the homegrown touch typing I've been practicing for the past two decades might not be _technically_ correct.

*   I heartily second [Tom's recommendation](https://tomstu.art/weeknotes-3-sweating-and-swearing) for "[Booksmart](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1489887/)" especially as it is currently [free for Prime Video subscribers in the UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Booksmart-Kaitlyn-Dever/dp/B07V2SLM3K).

*   I took [Ze Frank's "Human Test For People Who Work In An Office"](https://youtu.be/l2tVGctt4Zo):

    > Has a co-worker ever said---in the nicest way---"you look tired" when, in fact, you weren't tired at all but now you feel bad because you know you look like crap for some unknown reason and somehow your co-worker gets credit for caring?

*   I thought of [Ben Rosen being taught to use Snapchat by his 13-year-old sister](https://www.buzzfeed.com/benrosen/how-to-snapchat-like-the-teens) as I posted my first [Instagram story](https://help.instagram.com/1660923094227526) despite having previously railed at them. I hadn't understood that people's responses would be both private and much more personal than a shallow "like".

    Maybe I've been [yelling at clouds](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud) all along.
