As [Maciej put it](https://zerodivisionerror.substack.com/p/the-one-after-a-while):

> I feel that if I start explaining why I have not written sooner, I'll end up not finishing this post at all, so instead let me just skip that part altogether.

Following reflections on [2018](/2019/01/02/2018-yearnotes/), [2019](/2020/01/05/weeknotes-10/) and [2020](/2021/01/03/weeknotes-62/) and having fixed a drier, recharged a car battery and eaten far too much over the past fortnight, it's time to consider the [2021st year of the Common Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021).

*   [This time last year](/2020/12/21/weeknotes-59-and-60/) we moved in with my parents for "the foreseeable" following the death of my grandfather and only a day or two before [Coronavirus tier 4](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/948593/COVID-19_Tier_Posters_16_December_2020_04.pdf) was introduced.

*   We stayed for six months, only returning to London to sell our flat and leave the city after calling it home for 12 years.

*   We moved to Ilkley, a town picked largely at random and because it is approximately 30-40 minutes' drive from both my and E's families.

*   C gets to see his grandparents almost weekly and we all celebrated his second birthday together.

*   After seven months in West Yorkshire, I'm slowly losing confidence in how to pronounce the word "butter".

*   Last year's weeknotes began with new running shoes and E and I managed weekly runs while living at my parents' but---despite our proximity to [the moor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkley_Moor)---the rest of the year has been much more sedentary.

*   I'm still working my way through [two boxes of Hallowe'en sweets](/2021/11/06/weeknotes-105-107/).

*   While E and I are fully vaccinated and now boosted, the month before Christmas was mostly spent miserable with various colds brought home from nursery by C.

*   I overcame my fear of modern CSS by taking [Josh Comeau's "CSS for JS" course](https://css-for-js.dev).

*   Almost all of the TV shows I watched involved some sort of comforting competition between skilled craftspeople: [The Great Pottery Throwdown](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-great-pottery-throw-down), [The Great British Bake-Off](https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk), [Handmade: Britain's Best Woodworker](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/handmade-britains-best-woodworker), [MasterChef: The Professionals](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mx9xb).

*   I remain incapable of properly relaxing and the daily routine of having a two year old certainly hasn't helped. Working from home has been fantastic for many reasons but it adds to the [Groundhog Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)) feeling of the past year. I'm not entirely sure how to address that but I'll start by trying to see local friends with greater regularity than once every few months.

*   As for my deteriorating fitness: my hamstrings currently ache from my first run in months and I will attempt to run along the [River Wharfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Wharfe) every weekend.
