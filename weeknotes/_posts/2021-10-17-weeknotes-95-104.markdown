- It was a mistake to number my weeknotes by weeks rather than by notes.
- We are on holiday for the first time since C’s first birthday over a year ago.
	
    We had a false start as the “eco lodge” we booked for the week was littered with mouse droppings. We’re now in our second accommodation, E has made a fire and I’m feeling more relaxed.
- C continues to bring home from nursery a variety of colds and, on one occasion, [hand, foot and mouth disease](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/hand-foot-mouth-disease/) (not to be confused with [foot and mouth](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/foot-and-mouth-disease)).
- I haven’t [played Marvel’s Spider-Man](/2021/08/15/weeknotes-83-94/) as I enjoyed [Psychonauts 2](https://www.doublefine.com/games/psychonauts-2) instead, released five years after I became its 14,463rd backer.
- In order to bring my CSS knowledge up-to-date I’ve been working through [Josh Comeau’s “CSS for JS” course](https://css-for-js.dev/). I was hesitant at first but I’ve learnt an incredible amount in the first two modules. I realise I’ve never understood the different [box models](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model), [margin collapsing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Mastering_margin_collapsing) or even how [positioned layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning) works until now.

    A lot of this has influenced my work on the new [raspberrypi.com](https://www.raspberrypi.com/).
- C has two great loves: road vehicles and birds. We alternate between [Grace’s](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0009mbx) (formerly [Catie’s](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06m8m6y)) Amazing Machines and scrolling through the [Collins Bird Guide iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/collins-bird-guide/id868827305).
- I had to move a subdomain to another domain for a website served by [Amazon S3’s static website hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html) and [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). I couldn’t find examples of redirecting from one domain to another without setting up a new distribution for the new domain and a new S3 bucket to [redirect all requests from the old domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/how-to-page-redirect.html#redirect-endpoint-host).

    I avoided the new bucket and distribution by creating a new SSL certificate for both the old and new domain using [Amazon Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) and then updating the existing CloudFront distribution to use that certificate and the new domain as an [alias](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/CNAMEs.html#CreatingCNAME).
	
    With both domains now serving requests, I deployed the following Lambda@Edge function and associated it with CloudFront as a [`viewer-request` function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-cloudfront-trigger-events.html). This way, there’s one bucket and one distribution, both domains serve traffic but requests to the old will be permanently redirected to the new:

    ```javascript
    exports.handler = async (event) => {
        const request = event.Records[0].cf.request;
        const host = request.headers.host[0].value;

        if (host.endsWith('.old.domain')) {
            return {
                status: '301',
                statusDescription: 'Moved Permanently',
                body: '',
                headers: {
                    'location': [
                        {
                            key: 'Location',
                            value: `https://new.domain${request.uri}`
                        }
                    ]
                },
            };
        }

        return request;
    };
    ```
- I second [Cabel Sasser’s recommendation to add a large Photos widget on your Home Screen](https://www.twitter.com/cabel/status/1426269188348268548) once you [tell it which people you don’t want featuring](https://www.twitter.com/cabel/status/1426270646468714496).
- DIY improvements on our house have stopped after disconnecting useless telephone and aerial cables, replacing the thermostat, fixing the fridge door with [Sugru](https://sugru.com/) and filling holes in the external walls with silicone.
