*   We exchanged contracts on both [the sale of our flat](/2021/02/07/weeknotes-67/) and the purchase of a house in [Ilkley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkley).

*   With under two weeks to go before we complete, I'm struggling to get my head around having a place of our own again. You will mostly find me methodically working through checklists of utility companies, local councils and broadband providers in [Trello](https://trello.com).

*   E and I both have our first [Coronavirus vaccinations](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/) tomorrow. I look forward to catching the end of [May 2021](https://xkcd.com/2459/).

*   After completing "[Ori and the Blind Forest](/2021/05/02/weeknotes-79/)", I invested in a [Nintendo Switch Pro controller](https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en_gb/-nintendo-switch-pro-controller-000000000002510466.html) and finished "[Ori and the Will of the Wisps](https://www.orithegame.com)" too.

    It was even more glorious than the first game, clearly taking a lot of inspiration from another beloved [Metroidvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania), "[Hollow Knight](/2019/01/02/2018-yearnotes/)".

    I enjoyed ["On the Level" with Chris McEntee about some of Ori's game design](https://youtu.be/gIdHTL18kTU) though it does spoil part of the game.

    I hoped the Pro controller would help with the [repetitive strain injury](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/repetitive-strain-injury-rsi/) playing the Switch gives me but sadly it continues to wreak some amount of havoc on my wrists.

*   I completed one more orbit around the sun.
