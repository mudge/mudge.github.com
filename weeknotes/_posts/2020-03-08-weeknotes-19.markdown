excerpt: The Missing Hit, hot lemon and honey, Ugly Delicious and a reassuringly dumb baby monitor.

*   I followed [Andy Baio's recommendation](https://twitter.com/waxy/status/1235716731877961728) and enjoyed listening to [Reply All's "The Case of the Missing Hit"](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/o2h8bx/158-the-case-of-the-missing-hit). To avoid spoiling anything, I won't say any more but it's a good one.

*   Despite the current climate of [hand washing](https://twitter.com/getbentsaggy/status/1235229738504990720) and sneezing into elbows, I've managed to catch a cough. [NHS 111](https://111.nhs.uk) reassures me it is nothing more and I have been consuming a record number of lemons in the form of hot drinks. The timing is unfortunate but at least I don't need to worry about scurvy.

*   [Jean](https://www.theportablebrain.com) reminded me that the second season of "[Ugly Delicious](https://www.netflix.com/title/80170368)" is now on Netflix.

    I loved the first season for exploring the complicated notion of "authenticity" in food and its related sociopolitical baggage. While waiting for more, I tried to watch ["Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner" (also starring David Chang)](https://www.netflix.com/title/81038022) but the first episode---where Chang gets high with his celebrity friend Seth Rogen---put me off. Thankfully, the first episode of the new season centres on Chang as a nervous dad-to-be so I'm hooked once more.

    From [Chang's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9NzY9KhpeW/), I discovered there is [ritual called "Zhuazhou"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuazhou) where a child picks an object that forecasts their future. I'm now planning to perform this ritual with C, placing before him a keyboard, a sword and a plastic dough scraper.

*   We successfully completed the [2,000 year old problem of moving C into his own room](/2020/03/02/weeknotes-18/) and so were finally in the market for some sort of baby monitor. As a real [Internet of Things sceptic](https://twitter.com/internetofshit), I was adamant that we buy no device with the word "Smart" in its name. Thankfully, we bought the decidedly dumb [BT Audio Baby Monitor 400](https://shop.bt.com/products/bt-audio-baby-monitor-400-087429-CLWL.html) and it is wonderful in its simplicity.
